# Appimage Package Manger
A CLI tool to download and install, and manage Appimages

## Usage

In your terminal, simply just run "apm install (thing to install)" or you can remove with the same logic. In the installation box, you can put the owner and repository of what you want to download (such as "mapeditor/tiled") or, if they are the same, you can just do the name (such as Audacity, which is audacity/audacity)

## Installation

Just download the binary in the latest release and move it to either ~/.local/bin for user installation or usr/bin for global installation. Or you can run this:
```bash
wget https://github.com/Zybyte85/APM/releases/latest/download/apm -P ~/.local/bin && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/apm
```
